## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation. It might be better to cache
## inverse of matrix instead of computing it repeatedly. Below functions will do
## the job.

## Cache matrix and its inversion.
## param x: original matrix.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Call makeCacheMatrix to get the inverse of a matrix
## param x: original matrix.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
